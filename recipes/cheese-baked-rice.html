    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This <em>baked cheesy rice</em> is ridiculously easy and so delicious. It's a crowd pleaser that goes with almost any main dish and is a neutral staple in my recipe box! Cheesy, easy and fabulous!
        Otherwise known as, the side to go with everything!

    <p>
        I get it. This looks like a verrrrrry boring baking dish filled with rice.
        But I promise it is not that. Well, okay. It is that.
        But minus the boring! This is not plain old rice. Though there is nothing wrong with that. I have always loved plain old rice!
